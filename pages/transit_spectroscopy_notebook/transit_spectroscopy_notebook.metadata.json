  "description": "## Load packages\n\nThis notebook uses packages (matplotlib, astropy, scipy, glob, lmfit, pickle, os, sklearn) which can all be installed in a standard fashion through pip.\n\nSeveral routines to calculate limb-darkening and a transit model were extracted from ExoTiC-ISm \n(__[Laginja & Wakeford 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JOSS....5.2281L/)__ ;\nhttps://github.com/hrwakeford/ExoTiC-ISM), and slightly adapted. The full set of stellar models used for the limb-darkening calculation can also be downloaded from ExoTiC-ISM, as this notebook only downloads and loads the single stellar model used to generate the limb darkening.\n"
